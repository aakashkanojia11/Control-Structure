# Control-Structure
               # TASK1 
# Even or Odd Number Checker
## Description
This is a simple Python program that allows users to input an integer and checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement. The result is then displayed accordingly.

## Features
- Takes user input (an integer).
- Determines whether the number is even or odd.
- Displays the result in a user-friendly format.
  
# How It Works
The program takes input from the user using input().
It converts the input into an integer using int().
The modulus operator (%) is used to check divisibility by 2.
If the number is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0), it is even; otherwise, it is odd.

              #TASK 2
# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

## Description
This simple Python program iterates over numbers from 1 to 50 and calculates their sum using a `for` loop. It then displays the final sum to the user.

## Features
- Uses a loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
- Adds each number to a running total.
- Prints the final sum to the console.

  # How It Works
Initializes a variable total_sum to store the sum.
Iterates over numbers from 1 to 50 using for num in range(1, 51).
Adds each number to total_sum.
Displays the final sum using print().
